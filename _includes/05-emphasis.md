My *personality* can best be described as **independant, enthusiastic, creative, tenacious, flexible and customer-oriented.**
I thrive when I can use some of my natural competences and learned skills, which include *- but are not limited to -*:
* **Empathy**
* **Organizing / structuring**
* **Visual presentation** *(I strongly believe form and function should be in harmony)*
* **Communication** *(My natural empathy allows me to see all sides and function as the mediator between parties)*
